	Use:   "ssh-probe",
	Short: "ssh-probe is a ssh session tracker based on eBPF, that can be used to mitigate the impact of stolen credentials",
	Long: `ssh-probe is a ssh session tracker based on eBPF, that can be used to mitigate the impact of stolen credentials

ssh-probe relies on eBPF to track ssh sessions at runtime. Stolen credentials impact by requiring 2FA on each
sensitive action, as defined in the profile of each user.
More information about the project can be found on github: https://github.com/Gui774ume/ssh-probe`,
